The tutorial contains the topo directory which creates a very simple topology as show below:
`h1 <--> s1 <--> h2`
where `h1`, `h2` are P4Hosts and `s1` is the P4Switch
* `h1` has the IP address: `10.0.1.1`, mac address: `08:00:00:00:01:11`
* `h2` has the IP address: `10.0.2.2`, mac address: `08:00:00:00:02:22`
